## Automated, powerful computer vision and machine learning driven full stack software for professionals
Lotte Harper is a powerful, automated, machine learning driven full stack progressive web app built using Python, for expressive, social creators looking to build an online presence with modern software offering card and crypto payment processing with a number of processors, image, video, and audio upload and recording, ID scanning, enhanced biometric security features including facial recognition and biometric authentication as well as multi factor authentication and temporary one time codes, video chat (video meetings coming soon), games, voice donation, text to speech, transcription, image enhancement, programmable voice and SMS, a static frontend, marketing tools, remote control, recovery tools, full text search, an email server and integrated secure client, and a unix shell for authenticated administrators only. The software is also equipped with asynchronous tasks, a websocket server, stun server, and scheduled tasks. This is a full stack Python app with a purpose.

## About
This is a full stack web app focused on data visualization, machine learning, computer vision, facial recognition, biometrics, security, payment processing, marketing, ease of use, and more.

### To deploy
You will need a web server, a VPS with Linux support and at least 8GB of RAM to run this software. Start by creating a web server and follow the instructions below to copy data to it. I recommend https://vultr.com or https://linode.com for a web server, although there are others, including https://ionos.com, https://kamatera.com and more, depending on your needs in particular, as most VPS and cloud providers support this project and cost under $100, or even under $50 to run each month for larger projects, or even less than $20 for an entry level server.
Generate API keys for Google recaptcha, maps, and all other desired APIs.
Make sure to update any neccesary settings in settings.py as well. Next, edit scripts/convert to denote new names for the domain, directory, project, and user. Cd to the directory and run scripts/convert with `./scripts/convert` before running `./scripts/setup` and allowing the software to install (may take 20-30 minutes depending on database, server constraints, etc). Alternativley, you can also run scripts/init from the project, being sure to paste in your SSH key in order to gain access to the machine - if you don't, you might get locked out depending on your hosting provider (usually they can accomodate this). You can also even download scripts/init seperatley or paste it into your hosting provider's script panel with the domain correctly configured to point to the server. Make sure to change the names in the last part of the file, your SSH key, and also update the git repo url if you would like to deploy and maintain private fork of the app using the script (adding .gitignore in the backup script to make sure this is not published by the open sourcing engine publishing this repo). Copy and paste the IP address, ipv6 address, domain key, and all other neccesary records into the DNS configuration including the OpenDKIM key (for the opendkim milter), make sure to print this key with `sudo cat /etc/opendkim/keys/lotteh.com/sendonly.txt | tr -d '\n' | sed 's/\s//g' | awk -F'[)(]' '{print $2}' | sed '0,/""/{s/""//}'` after initialize. Lastly, add a reverse DNS (rDNS) record to your server with the domain name you are using through your hosting provider.
I recommend also setting a user password and a root password, with `sudo passwd team` (where team is the name of the user denoted in the convert script.
If you want to change names of anything in the future, you can always run scripts/convert again, just make sure to switch the names you used last with the current names and update the old names with new names (in the variables in the beginning of the file).

To deploy, scripts/init looks like this:
```
#!/bin/bash
# This script will build the project from source according to custom names and the public repository by default (it is the counterpart of a private script that simply builds my deployment of the app, you can make it do a similar thing by adding your fork of the repo in the GIT url)
# Use your SSH key
SSH_KEY='<SSH key here>'
# Use the git repo from the project
GIT_REPO='https://github.com/daisycamber/lotteharper'
# Add your project name and username here
PROJECT_NAME="yourproject"
USER_NAME="team"
GIT_PROJ=`echo $GIT_REPO | rev | cut -d/ -f1 | rev`
